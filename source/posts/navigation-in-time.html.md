# A post

## Intro
A post can begin with an introduction. It doesn't have to though. For a long post, I'd advise to have one, for a shorter one, it's probably not worth to put your readers through that effort.

## Another paragraph
So, now the reader's in your piece, with or without intro. It's time to give some solid info. The intention of this post is navigation in time. There are several options to do that, but we don't want to go too deep on that, do we?
